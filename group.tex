\section{Group in the Filament}
\label{sec:Group}

The group of galaxies within the large-scale filament is located a little over 2~Mpc SE of the cluster center, chosen to be at ${\rm RA} = 07:17:30.025$, ${\rm Dec} = +37:45:18.58$. The small size of the group and its large distance from the cluster implies that it is falling for the first time towards MACS~J0717.5+3745, rather than having traversed the cluster from the NW to the SE.

We measured the temperature and the brightness of the cluster by extracting spectra from an elliptical region shown in Figure~\ref{fig:fil}. We assumed a group metallicity of 0.2 solar. The best-fitting parameters are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:spectra}. The normalization is equivalent to a luminosity of $(1.05\pm 0.09) \times 10^{43}$~erg~s$^{-1}$. Based on the luminosity-mass scaling relations for galaxy groups \citep[e.g.,][]{Connor2014}, the group's luminosity corresponds to a mass of $\sim 5\times 10^{13}$~M$_\odot$.

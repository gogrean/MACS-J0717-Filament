The red hexagon marks the position of the group's centrally dominating galaxy. The position of the BCG coincides with those of the radio AGN and of the X-ray peak.\label{fig:group}}

The group of galaxies within the large-scale filament is located in projection a little over 2~Mpc SE of the cluster center, fixed at ${\rm RA} = 07^{\rm h}\, 17^{\rm m}\, 30.025^{\rm s}$, ${\rm Dec} = +37^{\circ}\, 45\arcmin \, 18.58\arcmin\arcmin$ for consistency with \citet{Jauzac2012}. The small size of the group and its large distance from the cluster implies that it is falling for the first time towards MACS~J0717.5+3745, rather than having traversed the cluster from the NW to the SE. This interpretation is also supported by the fact that the position of the X-ray peak is consistent with those of the cD galaxy and of the AGN hosted by the galaxy, as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:group}.

We measured the temperature and the brightness of the group by extracting spectra within $r_{\rm 2500} \approx 300$~kpc \citep{Medezinski2013}. The circular region, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:fil}, had the center fixed at ${\rm RA} = 07^{\rm h}\, 17^{\rm m}\, 53.347^{\rm s}$, ${\rm Dec} = +37^{\circ}\, 42\arcmin \, 09.25\arcmin\arcmin$. We assumed a group metallicity of 0.2 solar \citep[e.g.,][]{Rasmussen2007}. The best-fitting parameters are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:spectra}. The cluster has a $r_{2500}$ temperature of $4.19_{-0.48}^{+0.76}$~keV. The normalization is equivalent to a bolometric luminosity of $(1.2\pm 0.1) \times 10^{44}$~erg~s$^{-1}$. Based on the luminosity-mass scaling relations for galaxy groups \citep[e.g.,][]{Connor2014}, the group's luminosity corresponds to $M_{\rm 2500} = \sim 5\times 10^{13}$~M$_\odot$. A similar mass estimate is obtained from the temperature-mass scaling relations.  Using optical data, \citet{Medezinski2013} determined $M_{\rm 2500} = (7.4\pm 3.0) \times 10^{13}$~M$_\odot$, which is consistent with our estimate. The group thus sits on the luminosity-mass and temperature-mass relations, which is further indication that no significant stripping by the cluster has occurred yet.

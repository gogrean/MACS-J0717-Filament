The red hexagon marks the position of the group's centrally dominating galaxy. The position of the BCG coincides with those of the radio AGN and of the X-ray peak.\label{fig:group}}

The group of galaxies within the large-scale filament is located a little over 2~Mpc SE of the cluster center, chosen to be at ${\rm RA} = 07^{\rm h}\, 17^{\rm m}\, 30.025^{\rm s}$, ${\rm Dec} = +37^{\circ}\, 45\arcmin \, 18.58\arcmin\arcmin$ for consistency with \citet{Jauzac2012}. The relatively regular morphology of the group and its large distance from the cluster implies that it is falling for the first time towards MACS~J0717.5+3745, rather than having traversed the cluster from the NW to the SE; a galaxy group that had already traversed the cluster would be expected to have a more disturbed morphology. This interpretation is further supported by the fact that the position of the X-ray peak is consistent with those of the cD galaxy and of the AGN hosted by the galaxy, as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:group}.

We measured the temperature and the brightness of the group by extracting spectra from an elliptical region shown in Figure~\ref{fig:fil}. We assumed a group metallicity of 0.2 solar. The best-fitting parameters are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:spectra}. The normalization is equivalent to a luminosity of $(1.05\pm 0.09) \times 10^{43}$~erg~s$^{-1}$ in the energy band $0.1-2.4$~keV. Based on the luminosity-mass scaling relations for galaxy groups \citep[e.g.,][]{Connor2014}, the group's luminosity corresponds to a mass of $\sim 5\times 10^{13}$~M$_\odot$.

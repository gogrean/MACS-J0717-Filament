The repository contains the LaTeX files and figures of the paper, as well as Jupyter notebooks and additional Python code that can be used to reproduce the Chandra data analysis and the plots. The FITS images used to create the figures are in the `data` directory. If you use any of the FITS images in your own work, please cite this paper for the X-ray image and van Weeren et al, in prep. for the radio image.

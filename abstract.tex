We present results from deep \chandra\ observations of the large-scale filament extending SE from the massive Frontier Fields cluster MACS~J0717.5+3745. The filament was previously found to have a length of $\sim 19$ Mpc. Within the filament, about 2~Mpc away from the cluster center, there is a galaxy group with a mass of $\sim 5\times 10^{13}$~M$_\odot$ and a temperature of $\sim 3$~keV. This group is likely infalling for the first time towards the cluster. The filament is brightest in X-ray in the region between the group and the cluster. Here, the gas is found to have a temperature of $1.58_{-0.25}^{+0.51}$~keV and a density of $\sim 10^{-4}$~cm$^{-3}$. The filament density corresponds to a relatively high over-density of $\sim 100$ relative to the critical density of the Universe, which can be explained by the fact that we are probing only the densest part of the filament. The filament properties are consistent with numerical simulations and with the few other observational results reported to date.

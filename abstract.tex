We present results from deep \chandra\ observations of the large-scale filament extending SE from the Frontier Fields cluster MACS~J0717.5+3745. The gas within the filament is found to have a temperature of $1.58_{-0.25}^{+0.51}$~keV and a density of $\sim 10^{-4}$~cm$^{-3}$. The filament density corresponds to a high baryon over-density of $\sim 250$, which can be explained by the fact that we are probing only the densest part of the filament. The filament properties are consistent with numerical simulations and with the few other observational results reported to date. Within the filament, $\sim 2$~Mpc away from the cluster center, there is a galaxy group with a mass of $\sim 5\times 10^{13}$~M$_\odot$ and a temperature of $\sim 3$~keV. This group is likely infalling for the first time towards the cluster. NW of the cluster, $\sim 670$~kpc from the center, there is a ram pressure-stripped core that appears to have traversed the densest parts of the cluster after entering the ICM from the direction of the filament. This core is probably a later stage of the galaxy group seen in the filament. We detect a density discontinuity N-NE of the core, which we speculate is associated with a cold front. We do not detect a temperature jump across the density discontinuity. The non-detection is likely caused by a combination of poor count statistics and multiple superimposed substructures.
